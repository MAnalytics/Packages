Description: Advances a longitudinal clustering technique, 'akmedoids' for partitioning trajectories based on the similarities of their long-term trend lines and uses the Calinski and Harabatz criterion to determine the optimal solution. The primary aim of this package is to provide the opportunity to cluster trajectories according to a theoretically-driven functional expectations.
             The package also include a list of other useful functions for exploring and manipulating longitudinal data/repeated dataset. A plot function is also included to visualise the results.
