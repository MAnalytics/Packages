Description: Advances a longitudinal clustering technique ('akmedoids') for grouping trajectories based on the similarities of their long-term trends and determines the optimal solution based on the Calinski-Harabatz criterion. Includes functions to extract descriptive statistics and generate a visualisation of the resulting groups. The package also include a number of other useful functions for exploring and manipulating longitudinal data prior to the clustering process.
