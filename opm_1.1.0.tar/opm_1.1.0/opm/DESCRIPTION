Description: Tools for analysing OmniLog(R) and MicroStation(TM)
    phenotype microarray (PM) data as produced by the devices
    distributed by BIOLOG Inc. as well as similar kinds of data
    such as growth curves. Major facilities are plotting data,
    accurately estimating curve parameters, comparing and
    discretising data, creating phylogenetic formats and reports
    for taxonomic journals, drawing the PM analysis results in
    biochemical pathway graphs optionally including genome
    annotations, running multiple comparisons of means, easy
    interaction with powerful feature-selection approaches,
    integrating metadata, using the YAML format for the storage of
    data and metadata, batch conversion of large numbers of files,
    and database I/O. (The suggested mboostDevel is from R-Forge
    and not necessary.)
