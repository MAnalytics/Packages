'Akmedoids' package updated 19th April 2019 (New version: v0.1.2)

### Updates:

I editted the vignette in order to display the title. Currently I have "Put the title of your vignette here" on the website (i.e. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/akmedoids/). This is totally my mistake.

I am sorry for any inconvenience.

Your faithfully.
Monsuru.
